## 📊 THE METRIC THAT MATTERS

### Primary Metric: % Install Within 24 Hours

**Target:** 40%+

**How to Measure:**
- Track signups
- Track installs (via API key usage or webhook)
- Calculate: (installs within 24h / signups) × 100

**What It Tells You:**
- < 20% → Major friction exists
- 20-40% → Some friction, needs improvement
- 40-60% → Good, but can improve
- 60%+ → Excellent onboarding

**If under 40%:**
- Demo site missing or unclear
- Install instructions confusing
- Too many steps
- Technical barriers
- Trust issues

## 🧠 What We're Actually Building

### Not a SaaS

### A Belief Engine

SMBs need to believe:
- ✅ **It works** → Demo site proves this
- ✅ **It's easy** → Install videos prove this
- ✅ **It won't break my site** → Test installs prove this
- ✅ **It won't require a developer** → Non-technical test proves this
- ✅ **It's not sketchy** → Professional demo + videos prove this

---

## ⚠️ STOP BUILDING CHECKLIST

### Do NOT Build:
- ❌ More integrations (Weebly, Webflow, BigCommerce)
- ❌ More preview modes
- ❌ More dashboard features
- ❌ More platform guides
- ❌ More components
- ❌ More features

### DO Build:
- ✅ Demo site (proof)
- ✅ Install videos (proof)
- ✅ Screenshots (proof)
- ✅ Test installs (validation)
- ✅ User feedback (validation)

---

## 🎯 Validation Questions

### If 10 SMBs Signed Up Today:

**Would they:**
- [ ] Install? (Target: 80%+ confidence)
- [ ] See value? (Target: 80%+ confidence)
- [ ] Capture a lead? (Target: 80%+ confidence)
- [ ] Stay? (Target: 80%+ confidence)

**If not 80% confident → Demo + proof comes first**

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### Don't Jump to Marketplaces Yet

**Wix Marketplace**  
**WordPress Directory**  
**Shopify App Store**

**Why:** Marketplaces multiply what already works. They don't fix broken conversion.

**When:** After you have:
- ✅ 40%+ install rate within 24h
- ✅ < 5 minute install time
- ✅ Zero technical barriers
- ✅ Clear proof it works

---

## 🧠 Strategic Validation

### The Real Test

**Can a non-technical SMB owner:**
1. Visit demo site → See it working ✅
2. Sign up → Get API key ✅
3. Visit install page → See their platform ✅
4. Copy code → One click ✅
5. Paste code → Clear instructions ✅
6. See chatbot → Working immediately ✅
7. Capture lead → Appears in CRM ✅

**If any step fails → That's what we fix**

## 🎯 This Week's Focus

**Not:** Building features  
**Not:** Adding integrations  
**Not:** Creating guides  

**Is:** Proving it works  
**Is:** Validating adoption  
**Is:** Measuring friction  
**Is:** Testing with real users
