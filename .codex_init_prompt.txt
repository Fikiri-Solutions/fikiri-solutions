# Codex Initialization Prompt
# Copy-paste this at the start of each Codex session

I'm working on the Fikiri Solutions codebase. 

CRITICAL: Please read these files first (I need you to explicitly read them):
1. .cursorrules - Main rulepack (architecture, security, performance rules)
2. COORDINATION.md - Multi-tool coordination (Cursor + Codex)
3. SIMPLICITY_RULE.md - Code simplicity guidelines
4. docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md - System architecture overview

After reading, please verify access:
1. Run: git status (to see recent changes)
2. Read: core/minimal_config.py (to verify file access)

Key rules from .cursorrules:
- Check git status before editing
- Follow .cursorrules guidelines
- Coordinate with Cursor on API changes
- Minimal scope changes (1-3 files per task)
- Preserve existing patterns

Domain boundaries:
- core/ → shared utilities
- services/ → business logic
- integrations/ → external connectors
- crm/ → CRM (crm/service.py canonical)
- email_automation/ → email pipeline
- frontend/ → React app

Before making any changes, always:
1. Run: git status
2. Read the file(s) you'll edit
3. Follow existing patterns
